Gameplay mod aiming to create a session-based PvP social game with a single winner. Players partake in regular Minecraft gameplay in a 2,000x2,000 
block area, while routine item drops grant players new artifacts to augment their experience. Players start with 4 lives and are unable to engage in direct PvP combat 
until they are on their final life, forcing players to work together in order to creatively harm their opponents.
